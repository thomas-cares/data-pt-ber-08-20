# Lab | Functions

## Introduction

In this lab we will learn the foundations of functional programming. To start off, we will mostly learn how to write and think functionally. 

## Getting Started

Open the python notebook in the "your code" directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have learned how to write code functionally and how to add a docstring to a function.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.
